<h1>Income Statements API - Finnworlds</h1>

<p><a href="https://finnworlds.com/finance-data/income-statements-api/">The Income Statements API</a> is available through JSON REST API and our databases are also downloadable as an excel or csv file.  We have historical income statements in our database from the IPO of all publicly traded companies. Through our API you can request individual components of the income statement over the history of a company, or you can request the entire income statement based on ticker symbol or ISIN number of a company. The API is very intuitive and easy to use</p>



<p><a href="https://finnworlds.com/">Finnworlds</a>Â Our clients are big enterprises as well as individual developers who use the financial data to develop their platforms without having to worry about maintaining an actual database. We take this worry away so that you can focus on your core business.</p>
